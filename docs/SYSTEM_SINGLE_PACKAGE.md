# Single-Package GLM-5.2-FP8 Inference System — design note

> **Scope.** A system design for running the *published* `zai-org/GLM-5.2-FP8`
> checkpoint on **one low-power package** — a custom FP8 compute die integrated in-package
> with **64 GB HBM** and **1 TB Flash** — instead of a multi-chip HBM cluster. It targets
> "the real 753B model runs, at interactive-ish speed, at low power," not datacenter-scale
> real-time serving.
>
> Numbers tagged **[EST]** are system-level estimates (market-/physics-derived), not measured
> RTL results. The compute datapath this wraps is the verified RTL in this repo (see
> [`ACCEL_GLM52.md`](ACCEL_GLM52.md) and the `*_fp8` units); the memory/streaming system here
> is **designed, not built**.

## 1. Goal

One package that runs GLM-5.2-FP8 (753B params, ~40B active/token, 1M context) by **storing
the whole model in cheap on-package Flash and streaming the per-token working set through
fast HBM into an FP8 compute die** — exploiting MoE sparsity (8/256 experts/layer) so only a
small fraction of the 753 GB is touched per token. Optimize for **low power / low heat**
(near-memory integration) over peak throughput.

## 2. The problem

| | Size [EST] | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Weights (FP8, 1 B/param) | **~753 GB** (725 GB are cold routed experts) | No chip holds it on-die or in HBM |
| Latent-KV cache @ 1M ctx | **~94 GB** (MLA; an MHA cache would be 5.36 TB) | Also too big for SRAM/HBM alone |
| Compute / token | **~80 GFLOP** (~40B active × 2) | *Small* — a modest die does it in ~80 ms |

The model is **memory-bandwidth-bound, not compute-bound**: per token you must *read* the
active weights (~22 GB of routed experts + ~28 GB hot), and that read time dwarfs the math.
So the design problem is a **memory hierarchy + streaming** problem.

```

Three components, three roles:
- **FP8 compute die** — the verified RTL (MLA attention, MoE, SwiGLU, RoPE, RMSNorm, LM head,
  MTP) with FP8 E4M3 weight matmuls + bf16 tail. Pulls weights via a streaming interface.
- **64 GB HBM** — the *fast working memory*: everything reused every token (hot weights), the
  KV working window, and the **routed-expert cache**.
- **1 TB Flash** — the *cheap bulk store*: the entire 753 GB FP8 model + KV overflow.

## 4. Memory tiering & map

| Tier | Size | Bandwidth [EST] | Contents | Reused every token? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| On-die SRAM | MBs | ~10s TB/s | activations, GEMM tiles, DSA index scratch, double-buffers | — |
| **HBM** | **64 GB** | **~1–3 TB/s** | **hot weights ~28 GB** (attention all layers, shared expert, dense FFN, router, embed/LM-head, norms) + KV working window + **expert cache ~34 GB** | hot: yes |
| **Flash** | **1 TB** | **~10s GB/s** | **full 725 GB cold routed-expert pool** + KV cold pages | no (streamed on demand) |

The split that makes it work: **non-routed params (~28 GB) are a *fixed* set used every
token → resident in HBM.** The **725 GB routed experts are a *data-dependent* set (8/256 per
layer, chosen at runtime) → live in Flash, streamed/cached on demand.**

## 5. Per-token dataflow

1. **Embed** token (bf16, HBM) → residual `x`.
2. For each of 78 layers:
   a. RMSNorm(x) (bf16, HBM).
   b. **MLA attention** — weight projections (W_dq..W_o) pulled FP8 from **HBM (hot)**; q·K
      score + softmax + weighted-V in bf16; KV append + DSA-gather of 2048 rows from the **KV
      window (HBM)** / overflow (Flash).
   c. **FFN** — dense layers (first 3): SwiGLU from HBM. MoE layers (75): **router** picks
      top-8 experts → for each, **check the HBM expert cache → hit: read HBM; miss: stream the
      ~37 MB expert from Flash into HBM, evict LRU** → SwiGLU; + shared expert (HBM).
   d. Residual adds (bf16).
3. Final RMSNorm + **LM-head GEMV** (bf16, HBM) → next-token logits → argmax/sample.
4. **Prefetch**: while layer L computes, DMA layer L+1's likely experts Flash→HBM (double-buffer).

Hot reads (~28 GB) come from HBM (~10–30 ms total). The **routed-expert reads (~22 GB) are
the bottleneck** — HBM-cache hits are fast, misses hit Flash.

## 6. The bottleneck — routed-expert streaming

Per token the MoE layers need **75 × 8 = 600 expert blocks** (~37 MB each) = **~22 GB [EST]**,
scattered data-dependently across the 725 GB pool. Speed is set by:

```
  t_token ≈ max( t_compute≈80ms , t_hot_HBM≈20ms , t_routed )
  t_routed ≈ (miss_rate × 22 GB) / Flash_BW   +   (hit × 22 GB) / HBM_BW
```

With a 34 GB expert cache (≈900 of 19,200 expert-instances) and expert-popularity skew +
batch reuse, the **miss rate** — not raw compute — governs throughput.

## 7. Performance model [EST]

Assuming in-package wide Flash ~50–100 GB/s, modest FP8 die (~1 TFLOP/s effective), batch=1:

| Config | Routed bytes/token | Dominant time | ~tokens/s |
|---|---|---|---|
| FP8, cold cache (all miss) | 22 GB | Flash 0.22–0.44 s | ~2–5 |
| FP8, 64 GB cache (skewed hits) | ~8–12 GB effective | Flash ~0.1–0.24 s | ~4–10 |
| **INT4** (re-quant), 64 GB cache | ~4–6 GB | Flash ~0.05–0.12 s | **~8–20** |
| + batching ×B | amortized /B | — | ~×B until compute-bound |
| + speculative/MTP ×K tokens/pass | /K weight passes | — | ~×K |

So: **a few tokens/s at FP8 batch=1, scaling to tens/s with INT4 + caching + batching +
speculative decoding.** Interactive, not real-time-serving. Compute and the single die are
*not* the limit (the die idles waiting on Flash).

## 8. MoE expert-cache subsystem (the heart of it)

Because the active expert set is **data-dependent and changes every token**, routed experts
can't be statically placed — it's a **caching + scheduling** problem:

- **Cache** (HBM, ~34 GB): LRU/LFU of expert blocks; exploits expert-popularity skew.
- **Batching**: many tokens/sequences route to overlapping experts → load once, reuse across
  the batch (biggest throughput lever; costs latency).
- **Prefetch/predict**: speculate next experts (e.g. from prior-layer routing) and DMA ahead
  to hide Flash latency (can't hide Flash *bandwidth*).
- **Layout**: store co-activated experts contiguously / aligned for sequential Flash reads
  (bandwidth- not IOPS-bound, since each expert is a ~37 MB contiguous block).
- **Speculative / MTP decoding**: GLM-5.2 ships an MTP head (built here as `mtp_head`) — verify
  K tokens per weight-load pass → cut weight traffic ~K×.

## 9. Hardware ceiling vs software leverage

| | Sets it | Knobs |
|---|---|---|
| **Hardware ceiling** | raw Flash/HBM bandwidth, in-package bus width, **energy/bit**, compute rate | more channels, wider bus, more HBM, faster die |
| **Software leverage** | how much you *actually* move + when | batching, expert cache policy, prefetch, **quantization**, speculative/MTP, storage layout, scheduling/overlap |

Software can't beat the bandwidth/energy ceiling but **gets you close to it and cuts demand** —
exactly how today's stacks (vLLM, llama.cpp/KTransformers MoE offload, DeepSpeed ZeRO-Infinity,
FlexGen) run 600B+ MoE models on a single GPU + RAM/SSD.

## 10. Power / heat

The dominant dynamic energy is **moving ~22 GB/token of weights**. In-package near-memory
(short, wide buses) cuts the energy-per-bit of that movement by **~10–100× vs an off-package
PCIe SSD**, which is the lever for the low-power/low-heat goal. FP8's 4×4-mantissa multiply
(measured: `glm_matmul_fp8` uses 18× 7-bit multipliers, vs fp32's 24×24) also keeps the
compute die's dynamic power and DSP/area down — the FP8 datapath is *already* the low-power
choice on the compute side.

## 11. Cost — memory BOM [EST, 2025–26, volatile]

| Chip | $/GB | Qty | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| HBM3E | ~$15–25 (AI-shortage-driven) | 64 GB (≈ 2× 36 GB or 48 GB stacks in practice) | **~$1,000–1,600** |
| NAND Flash | ~$0.05–0.10 | 1 TB | **~$50–100** |
| **Memory chips total** | | | **≈ $1,100–1,700 (HBM is >90%)** |

Key point: **HBM dominates cost; the Flash that holds the entire 753 GB model is nearly free
(~$50–100).** *Not included:* advanced in-package integration (CoWoS / 3D stacking — $thousands/
package, capacity-constrained) and the custom compute-die NRE + die cost. For context, an H100's
80 GB HBM is ~$2k of its BOM.

## 12. Mapping to the committed RTL

**What this repo already provides (the compute die):**
- The full GLM-5.2-FP8 operator datapath, fp64/faithful-fp8 verified: `fp8_e4m3`,
  `glm_matmul_fp8`, `swiglu_expert_fp8`, `mla_attn_fp8`, `moe_router_fp8`,
  `glm_decoder_block_fp8`, and the capstone **`glm_model_fp8`** (full forward pass, next-token
  argmax matches the fp8 golden).
- **Streaming weight-pull interfaces** (`w_req`/`w_col` + per-[128,128]-block bf16 scales) on
  every unit — the weight *source is abstracted*, so HBM/Flash/host can drive them.
- The **`mtp_head`** for speculative decoding.
- A small-scale DMA append/gather streaming datapath (`tpu_soc`/`axi_master_dma`/
  `scatter_gather`/`cdc_async_fifo`) exercising the control logic.

**What this design adds (not built — the system layer):**
- HBM + Flash controllers / PHYs and the in-package interconnect.
- The **MoE expert-cache controller** (tag/LRU, miss → Flash DMA → refill/evict, prefetch).
- The KV-cache pager (append + DSA-gather of the 2048-row window; overflow to Flash).
- The runtime/scheduler (batching, prefetch, speculative-decode loop) — largely software.

## 13. Open questions / honest limits

- **Expert-cache hit rate** is the make-or-break unknown — depends on real GLM-5.2 routing
  skew + batch reuse; needs measurement on real routing traces.
- **In-package Flash bandwidth** (~10s GB/s) is assumed; real wide-NAND integration BW must be
  validated — NAND read physics caps it well below HBM.
- **64 GB HBM is comfortable for FP8** (hot 28 GB + ~34 GB cache); **48 GB is tight**, **INT4
  makes 32–48 GB roomy** (hot ~14 GB) — but INT4 means re-quantizing away from the published
  FP8 checkpoint.
- **Advanced-packaging cost/yield** for compute + 64 GB HBM + 1 TB Flash in one package is the
  real economic risk, separate from the chip BOM above.
- This is **interactive, not datacenter-real-time**; high tokens/s/user at scale still wants
  multi-chip HBM (bandwidth), which this design deliberately trades away for cost/power.
